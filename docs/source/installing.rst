Installing
----------

pip
~~~

atomium can be installed using pip:

``$ pip3 install atomium``

atomium is written for Python 3, and does not support Python 2. It currently
requires Python 3.5 and above.

If you get permission errors, try using ``sudo``:

``$ sudo pip3 install atomium``


Development
~~~~~~~~~~~

The repository for atomium, containing the most recent iteration, can be
found `here <http://github.com/samirelanduk/atomium/>`_. To clone the
atomium repository directly from there, use:

``$ git clone git://github.com/samirelanduk/atomium.git``


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

atomium requires the Python library
`NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ (for now) and
`requests <https://docs.python-requests.org/>`_ - pip will install these
automatically when it installs atomium.
