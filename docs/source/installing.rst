Installing
----------

pip
~~~

molecuPy can be installed using pip:

``$ pip install molecupy``

molecuPy is written for Python 3. If the above installation fails, it may be that
your system uses ``pip`` for the Python 2 version - if so, try:

``$ pip3 install molecupy``

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

molecuPy requires the Python libraries
`requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/>`_ and
`OmniCanvas <http://omnicanvas.readthedocs.io/>`_. These will be installed
automatically if molecuPy is installed with pip.

Otherwise molecuPy has no external dependencies, and is pure Python.
